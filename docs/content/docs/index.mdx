These docs are split up into /querying and /rendering.

/querying is for all of the integrations that have been made for querying from analytics providers

/rendering is wrappers around common charting libraries to make it easier to render the data

We provide wrappers around common charting libraries to make it easier to render the data so you don't have to worry about transforming the data into the correct format for the charting library
