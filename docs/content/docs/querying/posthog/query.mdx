The query client can be used with or without generating types. If you want autocomplete and type safety, you can generate types using the [generator](./generator).

## Basic Usage

Here is a basic example of how to use the query client.

We use the type import rather than passing in an object of event types in order to not have to import all of the events.

```ts
import { events } from "~/data/events";
import { PostHog } from "@typelytics/posthog";

const query = await posthog
  .query()
  .addSeries("$pageview", {
    sampling: "unique_session",
  })
  .execute({
    type: "area",
  });
```
