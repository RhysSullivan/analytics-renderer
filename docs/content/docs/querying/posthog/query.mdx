The query client can be used with or without generating events. If you want autocomplete and type safety, you can generate types using the [generator](./generator).

## Basic Usage

Here is a basic example of how to use the query client.

```ts
import { events } from "~/data/events";
import { PostHog } from "@typelytics/posthog";

const query = await posthog
  .query()
  .addSeries("$pageview", {
    sampling: "unique_session",
  })
  .execute({
    type: "area",
  });
```
