### Commit the generated file

After running the generation command, you will have a file with all of your events, it will look similar to the following:

```ts
const events = {
  $pageleave: {
    name: "$pageleave",
    properties: [
      {
        name: "fbclid",
        type: "String",
      },
      {
        name: "$active_feature_flags",
        type: null,
      },
    ],
  },
  $pageview: {
    name: "$pageview",
    properties: [
      {
        name: "fbclid",
        type: "String",
      },
      {
        name: "$active_feature_flags",
        type: null,
      },
    ],
  },
};
```

This file is safe to commit to your repository and should contain no secrets.
